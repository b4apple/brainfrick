# Brainfrick Programming Language Compiler 

This is (yet another) Brainfrick Programming Language Compiler. Several limitations will exist, such as Windows-only support, but as Father Time passes, I'll try to add more features and hopefully it'll have more features.

To-do list : 

- [ ] Command-line flags (feature rich)

- [ ] AST Parsing

- [ ] Direct interpreting

- [ ] C code-generation backend

- [ ] Virtual Machine code-generation backend

- [ ] WebAssembly code generation backend

- [ ] Remove all previous backends and swap with LLVM
